# Description - Server Application
*I wrote a service application in the form of RESTFUL API using spring framework, and a client application using spring MVC.
*The client presents a website where the user can submit a message to be stored in a SQL DB.
*The remote IP address, the DB connection string and the ports are configurable without recompiling.
